Sega would shoot themselves in the foot terribly for the first time, and maybe the worst time out of the long and storied history of Sonic the Hedgehog. Sega knew things weren't looking good for the series, and they needed a reboot. After the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, the reception of that game was so poor that Sega began crafting the concept of an entire series reboot. What began was development of one of the worst games ever made, and effectively the game that turned Sonic from a respectable franchise to the laughing stock of the video game world. Sega began touting a reboot, releasing promotional images for the release of Sonic 06 which did what they were intended to do. People began to get excited for where the game was headed and with the continued marketing building hype and with people talking about Sonic again, Sega proceeded to do what Sega does best, and rushed the development of Sonic 06 so badly to the point that the finished product seemed more like a tech demo and less like a playable video game. The final product was plagued with bugs and gameplay issues that made it nigh on impossible to complete the game in any enjoyable fashion. This game tarnished the franchise so badly, that everything else has been an attempt at correcting the terrible mistakes they made in 06.

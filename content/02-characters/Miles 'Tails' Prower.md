## Character Biography

Miles "Tails" Prower is [[Sonic The Hedgehog]]'s main companion since his [[content/01-origins/index|introduction]] in 1992 along with the game [[content/01-origins/index|Sonic The Hedgehog 2]]. Tails is incredibly smart, known for his ability to invent and create just about anything if he is given the time and the resources. One of Tails' most impressive feats was his ability to nearly completely recreate a [[content/01-origins/index|Chaos Emerald]]. Tails is a fox with two tails that he can use to fly around for short periods of time. [[Sonic The Hedgehog]] regularly takes advantage of this ability, and this becomes a core mechanic in the second game of the series. Tails' character is voiced by Colleen Ann O'Shaughnessey, who has done voice work for the franchise for the last 11 years. Even though he is known as the "smart" character, his initial purpose was to be a moronic child that served as comedic relief for the series, particularly in Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog.

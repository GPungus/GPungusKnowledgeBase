## Character Biography

The one and the only Blue Blur! Sonic the Hedgehog is the main protagonist of the franchise and has been since his [[content/01-origins/index|release]] in 1991. Sonic is known for his ability to run at insanely high speeds along with possessing quills that he uses to inflict damage on his enemies. He is incredibly adventurous, with a vehement sense of freedom. Even though he is typically off doing something, he is usually accompanied by his friends, [[Miles 'Tails' Prower]], [[Amy Rose]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna]]. While he is the main character, and undoubtedly the face of the franchise, he isn't afraid to rely on his friends, and has been saved on multiple occasions. His main enemy and combatant is [[Ivo Robotnik]], who has aspirations of taking over the world. Robotnik has attempted to kill/maim Sonic more times than can be counted, and often teams up with other characters in the series in order to achieve his goals.

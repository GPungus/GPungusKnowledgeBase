## Character Description

Amy Rose is a pink hedgehog that is good friends with [[Sonic The Hedgehog]]. She is known for her infatuation with Sonic, and has professed her love to him several times, over several different iterations of the story. While Sonic has never outright reciprocated Amy's love, he is very fond of her and has been willing to play her "knight in shining armor" more than a few times. Amy on her own is a bubbly, caring person who is perfectly capable of handling herself in a fight. She uses a metal hammer to fight her enemies, and is also capable of using her hammer to propel Sonic at incredibly high speeds. She was first introduced in 1993 in [[Sonic CD]] and is now voiced by Cindy Robinson who has been voicing her since 2010, serving as the longest standing voice actress for the character.

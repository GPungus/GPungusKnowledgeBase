## Description

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 released in 1992 and it continued the same style and format of the game before it. The mechanics largely remained unchanged apart from the addition of one major mechanic: [[Miles 'Tails' Prower]]. Sonic's right hand man makes his appearance in this game, and he serves as a gameplay mechanic as well as an addition to the universe and story. There were a series of creative differences at play during the creation of this game that caused a number of conflicts. A large portion of what was initially considered for the game was scrapped and later repurposed into what Sonic CD would become. Despite the fact that the game suffered creative conflicts amongst it's direction, it would release to excitement and anticipation, and would later go on to be considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The game has sold over 6 million copies and would go on to become the second best selling game on the Mega Drive. The success of the second game would set the series up positively for the next few entries, and this was the beginning of something very big for Sega and the Sonic Team.

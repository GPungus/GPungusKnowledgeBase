## Description

The first entry into the franchise was released in 1991 and served as a revolutionary take on the platforming genre that had largely been pioneered and expanded by Mario in the years prior. Sonic's entire ad campaign played around the idea of Sonic being new and cool, which was enough to get people talking about the new game. The marketing worked, and the games did too, as in the early years of the series, Sonic was going toe to toe with, and even outselling Mario. At its inception, Sonic was absolutely more popular than Mario, and he became the face of the 90s in the Video Game world. The game launched on the Sega Genesis and was developed by Sega and the Sonic Team. The 1991 game features Sonic on a solo adventure going through the iconic original levels like Green Hill Zone as he fights with Robotnik to free the animals powering his Badniks. This game establishes the cat and mouse game that will ensue throughout the rest of the franchise between Sonic and Robotnik.

## Knuckle Sandwich Pt. 2 

Sonic & Knuckles serves as Knuckles' first and primary entry into the series with him taking up a significant amount of gameplay in this game. Similar to later entries in the series, Knuckles is given the spotlight in at least half of the game, with Act 2 of each zone serving as the designated Knuckles level. Gameplay wise, not much had changed between Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, but introducing a major character that will come to play a big part in the franchise for many years to come is worth noting. Critically, the game was received positively, keeping in line with the good reception of the 2D Sonic games, however, it was mentioned that Sonic and Knuckles was a step up in difficulty compared to Sonic 3, allowing for a challenge for the more adept Sonic fan. The formula was largely the same, and this would continue for one more game before the series would begin dipping it's toes into other avenues, and giving way to the future of 3D Sonic.

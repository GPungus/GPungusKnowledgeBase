## Description

Sonic CD released in 1993 and introduced some of the most iconic characters in the series like Metal Sonic, and [[Amy Rose]]. At this point, Sonic had developed a bit of a reputation for it's music, and Sonic CD continued the run of excellent soundtracks. Of the 2D Sonic games, CD is considered to have some of the best music and is generally considered to be one of the best Sonic games ever released. The time travel feature that was originally planned for the second game was fully fleshed out in this game, allowing players to time travel between levels set in the past, present and the future. Metal Sonic would serve as a primary antagonist, and is a character that would continue to have a prominent role in the series, serving as Eggman's ideal counter to Sonic the Hedgehog. Metal Sonic would not only be one of the most iconic characters, but one of the longest lasting, with Metal Sonic being apparent in pretty much every iteration of Sonic from here on out.

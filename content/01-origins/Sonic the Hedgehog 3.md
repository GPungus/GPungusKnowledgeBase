## Description

Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is one of the strangest releases out of the 2D games, as the game is technically a two part release with part one being Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and part two being Sonic and Knuckles. The game was initially slated to be a 3D entry, but the idea was shelved once again forcing the game to enter rush mode with only half of the allotted development time to present a finished product. One notable thing about this game is that Michael Jackson initially composed a portion of the soundtrack, but later left the project and went uncredited. It is unclear how much of his work was retained within the soundtrack, and how much of it was replaced in the rereleases of Sonic the Hedgehog 3. One of the driving factors between the split release of the two games was because of a McDonalds partnership, and a forced deadline that required Sonic 3 to come out prior to Sonic and Knuckles. Despite all of the carnival kerfuffle around Sonic 3, the game came out to the same success that it's predecessors had seen, and the critics still loved it. However, at this point in the series, critics began to believe that the games were innovating too little between the entries. Still not a problem at this point in time, and these two games were an overall success.

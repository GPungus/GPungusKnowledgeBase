Sega and Sonic Team tried to do far too much, far too quickly, relying on the success that they had during the 90s to uphold the majority of their projects from then on out. Sega was trying to do comics, with Archie Comics and later with IDW. They also tried to do shows, with things like [[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]] which began in the 90s and later continuing on that effort in the 2000s with shows like [[Sonic X]] and even in the 2010s with [[Sonic Boom]]. On top of this, they partnered with Nintendo to bring titles like Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games, and other spinoff titles that took the majority of their focus away from the mainline entry. As mentioned before, Sega never had the capital, the staff, nor the brainpower to uphold all of these different avenues at once, and as a result the mainline entries began to suffer. In the 2000s, we saw the release of Sonic Adventure which, as a whole was received positively by the Sonic fans, but generally speaking is a poorly made game with repetitive gameplay lacking ideas. This trend would become consistent with the releases in the early 2000s, and would only get worse as Sega continued on down the path it was headed.

After the disaster of 06, Sonic was no longer a video game franchise and more something that existed for people to point and laugh at, and a shining example for video game studios of what not to do with their existing games and projects. Sega knew they had messed up badly, and they would earnestly try to make up for it. Unfortunately for Sega, the direction was far from what it used to be, and they had no idea where to go after 06. Other terrible entries into the series included Sonic Riders, Sonic Rivals, etc. Sega continued to make the same mistakes with every game, and continued to put game out into the market which no one had asked for, and had no place existing amongst it's competitors when comparing the level of time and effort. Sega also began to place an overemphasis on motion controls shortly after the release of Sonic 06 with the release of titles like Sonic and the Secret Rings and Sonic and the Black Knight. These titles hardly served as mainline entries, and are pretty much unplayable by today's standards. These games were so miserable to play, that popular let's players like Game Grumps and others began to play these games simply because of how bad they were. Sonic games had gotten so bad that it was less fun to play them and more fun to laugh at how terribly wrong Sega had gotten it wrong.

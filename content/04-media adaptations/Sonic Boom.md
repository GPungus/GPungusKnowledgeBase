## Solid and successful 

Sonic Boom is a collaboration between Sega of America and OuiDol productions to create what is considered one of, if not, the best entry into the media adaptations. The animation was cheap and good enough to pass in the eyes of pretty much anyone, and even though it is largely considered a kids show, it is enjoyed by people of all ages both inside and outside of the Sonic community. The show featured the main cast of characters that everyone has come to know and love, and also introduced a plethora of fun and memorable characters that became the favorites of many fans, both new and old. It premiered on the 8th of November in 2014 and ran for 104 episodes spanned across 2 seasons. Cartoon Network ended up picking up Sonic Boom, which allowed the show to take off in popularity and continue to keep the series in a state of relevance moving into the mid 2010s. Importantly, the show boasted continuity with the voice actors, with Roger Craig Smith appearing on the show to voice Sonic The Hedgehog, along with Colleen O' Shaughnessey who appears on the show to voice Tails. Having two of the most iconic voices on the show has given the adaptation credibility and has offered a major point of contention for maintaining voice actors across all mediums.

## What could've been

Sonic X was the first show of the 2000s, and the first show to feature the majority of the primary cast. It featured the modern characterizations of Tails and Sonic, along with introducing some of the most beloved characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], [[Amy Rose]] and Rouge the Bat. Unlike the previous entries in the category, the show was produced by TMS Entertainment along with Sega and Sonic Team. The show was broadcasted in the United States by 4Kids, which was important for the commercial success of the series as 4Kids was a large player in the children's TV market. Generally speaking, the series is considered a mild success, with lukewarm ratings and generally dedicated fanbase that still talks about the show positively today. Much of the community will say the same when talking about the show in the sense that it could've been so much better. With the cast of characters that Sonic X brought to TV, it easily could've been the best piece of Sonic media, maybe even standing on its own outside of the games. Unfortunately, plot devices and the overreliance on parasocial relationships drags the show down a few pegs. Overall, a respectable effort and something that many will still say is worth watching today.

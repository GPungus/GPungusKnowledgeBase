### Where it all began

The Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog is the first media adaptation of the series, and was meant to serve as a run-of-the-mill children's show with the first ever characterization of characters like Sonic and Tails. The show aired in 1993 and served as the gateway to the rest of the Sonic media that would follow. Generally speaking, within the community, the show is viewed favorably and is often looked back on as an underappreciated gem within the franchise. Featuring some of the most prominent characters within the franchise, Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog holds up even in today's standards. The show featured a much different interpretation of [[Miles 'Tails' Prower]] as a character, instead choosing to portray him as a dimwitted child that served as comedic relief to Sonic. This characterization of Tails would not last long, as the games would later go on to portray Tails as a brilliant inventor, offering a stark contrast to Sonic's simpleminded nature. The show was created by Sonic Team, DIC entertainment and Sega. It ran for 65 episodes and was one season long.

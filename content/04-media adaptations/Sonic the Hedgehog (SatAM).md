## Same year, different tone

Sonic The Hedgehog, commonly referred to as SatAM, released in the same year as Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, but opted to follow a darker, more dramatic tone than the other series that was running that year. This show followed Sonic and the Freedom Fighters, a group of characters that were introduced in the Archie Comics run of Sonic the Hedgehog. The show was also produced by DiC entertainment and co-produced by Sega of America. Unlike Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, the show did not run for as long, only running for a total of 26 episodes spanned across two seasons, but much like Adventures, the show was received positively, and a lot of fans look back on these two shows with general positivity and fondness. SatAM could've ran for longer, but due to network changes and declining ratings, the show was pulled off of the air. The story told in SatAM continued in the Archie comics which continued to run for quite some time after the discontinuation of SatAM. Since the show was being aired at the same time as Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, there was some overlap in the voice actors, like Jaleel White returning to voice Sonic, while largely replacing the rest of the familiars, like Tails and Robotnik.

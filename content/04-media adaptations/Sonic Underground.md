## Sonic at the end of the 90s

Sonic Underground would serve as the series' next media entry, and like the previous entry, it wouldn't run for very many episodes. Sonic Underground was first aired in January of 1999, and it only ran for 1 season with 40 episodes. Much like SatAM before it, the show was plagued by declining ratings and an overall less enthusiastic fanbase than the years prior, but unlike SatAM, the cartoon was generally considered to be bad. At both the time of airing, and even now, the community commonly refers to Sonic Underground as the Sonic cartoon ever made. Since the show was pulled from the air like SatAM, it ended without a resolution in the story. This added on to the already terrible mess that was Sonic Underground. Like the shows before, it was produced by DiC entertainment, but introduces some new characters to the franchise that have a pivotal role in the show but are never mentioned again throughout the series, like Sonia, and Manic, Sonic's brother and sister. One notable thing about this show is that it features Knuckles' first appearance, and unfortunately would serve to be a terrible introduction into the media adaptations.
